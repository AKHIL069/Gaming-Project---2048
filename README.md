# Gaming-Project---2048
2048 is a single-player game where the player makes actions on a 4 x 4 grid. Initially, there is an empty 4 x 4 grid except two ‘2’ tiles placed on the board randomly. The player moves first, then the computer spawns a ‘2’ tile on an empty grid randomly. When it is the player’s turn, the player will make an action choosing one cardinal direction, ‘sliding’ the entire board in that direction. All non-empty tiles will move towards the edge of the chosen side if able. If two tiles with the same numerical value collide, they will merge and a tile twice the merged value will be spawned. The player wins if a tile with value 2048 is spawned, and loses if no more moves is available.
